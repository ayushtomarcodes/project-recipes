        Description
    </h2>    
    <p>
        If you love south Indian tiffin foods like Idli and Rava Upma, you likely love dosa, that crispy rice and lentil crepe that arrives at your restaurant table spilling over the sides of a plate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dosas are the original health food--they are packed with plant protein and gut-friendly bacteria. They are gentle on the stomach and are always vegan as well as gluten-free, soy-free and nut-free, so you can feed them to just about anyone.

        This simple dosa, without a potato stuffing, is also called a Sada Dosa. The recipe was handed down to me by my Tamilian sis-in-law and amazing cook Padmavathy Raghavan, or Paddu

        Ingredients
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 cups rice
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ cup poha
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ cup urad dal
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons chana dal
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ teaspoon fenugreek seeds
        </li>
    </ul>

        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Allow the rice and dal and other ingredients to soak for at least 8 hours or overnight. I usually soak them in the morning, blend up the dosa batter in the evening, and leave it to ferment overnight so I can make fresh dosas next morning.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Some traditionalists soak the rice and dal seperately, grind them separately, and then mix them. To me that just adds unnecessary steps and I prefer to just soak everything together and pay closer attention when I blend so I get the texture right. Rice takes just a little longer to blend than the dal, which is perfect because you want the dal to blend smoothly while the rice remains very slightly gritty. That helps the dosas turn out crispy.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Always drain out the water you soaked the rice and dal in and add fresh, preferably filtered water when you blend the batter.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            When you blend the mixture begin with less water and add more if needed. Keep in mind that you can always add more water to the batter if it's too thick but you can't take water out of it. For this recipe I needed just under a cup and a half of water.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Blend in two batches. My blender could handle all the ingredients at one time but I still blend half the ingredients at a time. This helps me control the water better--for instance, if I added too much water the first time I can add less water to the second batch and make sure my batter is the right consistency. Also if you don't have a high powered blender the quantity of the ingredients could end up overwhelming it.
