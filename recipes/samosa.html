    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A samosa (/səˈmoʊsə/) (listenⓘ) is a fried central Asian[2] pastry with a savoury filling, including ingredients such as spiced potatoes, onions, peas, meat, or fish. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It is made into different shapes, including triangular, cone, or crescent, depending on the region.[3][4][5] Samosas are often accompanied by chutney, and have origins in medieval times or earlier.[3] Sweet versions are also made. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Samosas are a popular entrée, appetizer, or snack in the cuisines of South Asia, the Middle East, Central Asia, East Africa and their South Asian diasporas.

            The filling for Samosas is typically vegetarian, made with roughly mashed potato that’s cooked up with spices, fresh green chilli and peas. Altthough you’ll see plenty of versions with meat (usually ground), I like to keep things traditional – regular readers know I don’t say that often!😂

            A key feature of the Samosa pastry is how flaky it is. This is achieved by rubbing ghee or oil into the flour until it resembles breadcrumbs, just like we do with Western shortcrust pastry!

            Don’t get stressed out about this part. It’s honestly not that hard. And if yours are a bit deformed and wonky, so what? It’s still going to taste amazing!!! And you can just say they’re “rustic”. 😉

            The trick to frying Samosas is to start on low heat, otherwise the pastry can burst open and the filling spills out into the hot oil!

            Samosas, like Pakoras, are typically served as a starter or snack, being the terrific hand-held size that they are. Though mind you, I’ve seen plenty of gigantic Samosas in my time. I can’t deal with the thought of the volume of oil required to fry those beasts! 😂
